# User Authentication System

This repository showcases a user authentication system developed using Node.js. The project demonstrates my problem-solving skills in implementing secure and efficient authentication mechanisms.

## Overview

The user authentication system includes the following features:
- **User Registration:** Allows new users to sign up with secure password hashing.
- **Login:** Authenticates users with email and password verification.
- **Session Management:** Manages user sessions with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Implements user roles and permissions to restrict access to different parts of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt
- **Other Tools:** (Include any additional libraries or tools used, e.g., dotenv, mongoose)

## Problem Solving Approach

- **Secure Password Storage:** Implemented bcrypt for hashing passwords, ensuring that user credentials are stored securely.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** Used JWT for managing user sessions, addressing the need for scalable and stateless authentication.
- **Error Handling:** Developed robust error handling and validation mechanisms to enhance user experience and system reliability.
- **Role Management:** Designed a role-based access control system to ensure proper authorization and secure resource access.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-authentication-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd user-authentication-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file and add your configuration settings:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```
5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- **Register:** Send a POST request to `/api/register` with user details.
- **Login:** Send a POST request to `/api/login` with email and password to receive a JWT token.
- **Access Protected Routes:** Use the JWT token in the Authorization header to access protected routes.
